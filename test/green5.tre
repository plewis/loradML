>  Optimality criterion = likelihood
>    All characters have equal weight
>    Likelihood settings:
>                  DNA substitution types = 6
>                       Exchangeabilities = estimated
>             GTR submodel classification = unrestricted
>                       State frequencies = estimated
>          Proportion of invariable sites = estimated
>                 Rates at variable sites = gamma, shape=estimated (4 categories [mean])
>                    Model correspondence = GTR+I+G

>      Number of distinct data patterns under this model = 185
>      Molecular clock not enforced
>      Starting branch lengths obtained using Rogers-Swofford approximation method
>      Trees with approximate log likelihoods 5% or further from the target score are rejected without additional iteration
>      Branch-length optimization = one-dimensional Newton-Raphson with pass limit=20, tolerance=1e-07
>      Multidimensional optimizer = Praxis (tol=0.0001)
>      Likelihood calculations performed in single precision
>      Vector processing enabled
>      Using standard Felsenstein pruning for computing likelihoods
>      Conditional-likelihood rescaling threshold = 1e-20
>
>  Initial 'Maxtrees' setting = 100
>  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if branch length is less than or equal to 1e-08
>  'MulTrees' option in effect
>  No topological constraints in effect
>  Trees are unrooted
